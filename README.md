# Undergradute Thesis
This repository contains every relevant file that was used to achieve the objective of training an ML model with audio from [Audioset Dataset](https://research.google.com/audioset/dataset/index.html).
This repository does not include the files that allowed to download the dataset, for that go to [audioset-processing](https://github.com/aoifemcdonagh/audioset-processing/pull/11).
## Input File Structure
To run `populate_dataset.py` you need to have the input directory as the following image:
![Input Dataset File Structure](./input_dataset_tree.png)
Each subfolder contains the preprocessed image in `.png` format that was obtained with `thesis_preprocessing.ipynb`.
